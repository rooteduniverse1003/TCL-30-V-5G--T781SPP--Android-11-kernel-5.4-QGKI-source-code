	  If you say Y to this option, support will be included for
	  the FocalTech's fingerprint sensor. This driver supports
	  both REE and TEE. If in REE, CONFIG_SPI_SPIDEV must be set
	  to use the standard 'spidev' driver
	  
	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called 'focaltech_fp'.
